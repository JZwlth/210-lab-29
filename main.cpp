// Define a function to simulate disease spread over time
    // Parameters: map of regions, number of time periods

// Define main function
    // Initialize a map to store region information, each associated with an array of lists for susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals

    // Open an external file to read initial data about individuals and populate the map
        // If file does not open, print an error and exit

    // Read data from file and populate map
        // For each line, extract IndividualID, RegionName, and DiseaseState
        // Insert IndividualID into the appropriate list in the array for their region based on DiseaseState (S, I, or R)

    // Close the file

    // Display the initial state of the simulation
        // For each region, display the counts of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals

    // Begin a time-based simulation for disease spread
        // For 25 time periods
            // Iterate through each region in the map
                // For each region, simulate disease transmission and recovery

                // Infection Phase:
                    // For each infected individual in the region
                        // Attempt to infect susceptible individuals in the same region
                            // For each susceptible individual
                                // Generate a random number to determine if infection occurs based on infection probability
                                // If infection occurs:
                                    // Move individual from susceptible list to infected list
                                    // Log that the individual became infected

                // Recovery Phase:
                    // For each infected individual in the region
                        // Generate a random number to determine if recovery occurs based on recovery probability
                        // If recovery occurs:
                            // Move individual from infected list to recovered list
                            // Log that the individual recovered

            // Display the state of each region after the current time period
                // Show counts of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals for each region

            // Optional: Wait or pause briefly to simulate the passage of time between periods

// End of main function
