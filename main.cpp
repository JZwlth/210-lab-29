// Define a function to simulate disease spread over time
    // Parameters: map of regions, number of time periods

// Define main function
    // Initialize a map to store region information, each associated with an array of lists for susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals

    // Read data from file and populate map
        // For each line, extract IndividualID, RegionName, and DiseaseState
        // Insert IndividualID into the appropriate list in the array for their region based on DiseaseState (S, I, or R)


            // Display the state of each region after the current time period
                // Show counts of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals for each region

            // Optional: Wait or pause briefly to simulate the passage of time between periods

// End of main function
